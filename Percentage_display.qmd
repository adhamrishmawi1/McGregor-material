## Percentage graphs

The intent of the upcoming graphs is to make a very common graph to demonstrate the percentage per year column and how current cities would or wont finish by designated time frame.

## Packages and data set

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
```

```{r}
data <- read.csv("~\\Mcgregor Project\\Data material\\CSV-extracts from sql\\Percent_per_year_lines.csv", header = FALSE)
Pecent_data_cleaned <- rename(data, name_city = V1, funding_per_year = V2, cost_avg_job_priv = V3, cost_avg_job_pub = V4, cost_avg_job_full = V5, percent_per_years = V6)
```

## make initial bar graph

```{r}
ggplot(perce, aes(x = name_city, y = percent_per_years, fill = funding_per_year)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "City", y = "Percentage", title = "Percentage by City in Year") +
  theme_minimal()

```
